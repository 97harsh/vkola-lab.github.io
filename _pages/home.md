Sanders Lab aims to identify the etiology of childhood neuropsychiatric disorders through the discovery of genetic risk factors. Over the past few years there has been rapid progress in identifying the genes that play a role in autism spectrum disorder (ASD). We aim to leverage these findings to build a more complete understanding of ASD and to extend this approach to other human disorders. 

There are four main areas of research:

1. **Gene discovery**: Genomic analysis of DNA using high-throughput sequencing and microarray technologies to identify genes and genetic loci involved in human disorders
2. **Sex bias**: Identifying genes and gene networks that lead to the preponderance of males diagnosed with autism spectrum disorder
3. **Heritability**: Integrating genomic and heritability data to understand how multiple risk factors lead to human disorders
4. **Functional convergence**: To understand how genetic variants lead to observed phenotypes we aim to identify functions shared by the genes identified

### Technologies and methods
The Sanders Lab is primarily a bioinformatic group that uses a wide range of genomic, bioinformatic, and statistical methods including: exome analysis, genome analysis, detection of de novo mutations, RNA-Seq analysis, simulations of genomic and population data, and automated analysis of microscopy images.

### Collaborators
We work with closely with numerous collaborators, including the [State Lab](https://www.mstatelab.com/) and [Bender Lab](https://benderlab.ucsf.edu/lab-members) at UCSF, the [Devlin Lab](http://www.psychiatry.pitt.edu/person/bernard-j-devlin-phd) at UPMC, the [Roeder Lab](http://www.stat.cmu.edu/~roeder/) at Carnegie Mellon, the [Sestan Lab](http://medicine.yale.edu/lab/sestan/index.aspx) and [Noonan Lab](http://medicine.yale.edu/lab/noonan/index.aspx) at Yale, and the [Talkowski lab](http://talkowski.mgh.harvard.edu/) at Harvard.
