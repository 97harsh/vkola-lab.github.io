Our laboratory is interested in the development and validation of novel machine learning algorithms that can tackle multimodal data ranging from magnetic resonance imaging scans to high resolution microscopy images. 

We are currently interested in the following questions that have clinical relevance:

1. **Neurodegeneration** -- How can we develop software frameworks that can assist dementia screening in various settings? 
2. **Digital pathology** -- How can we build clinical-grade software tools to complement the pathologist workflow?

We are also interested in the following frameworks that have computational relevance:

1. **Domain generalization** -- Development of deep neural networks that can learn from multimodal data and generalize well across multiple data cohorts
2. **Representation learning** -- Construction of efficient neural models on high resolution data to process local and contextual information

### Joining our laboratory
We form small teams comprising individuals with complementary expertise and work persistently to build comprehensive solutions. If you are interested in joining us, then we encourage you to contact an active lab member and talk about your interests. 

### Funding
We are grateful for funding from the [American Heart Association](https://www.heart.org), the [National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute](https://www.nhlbi.nih.gov), the [National Cancer Institute](https://www.cancer.gov), and the [National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases](https://www.niddk.nih.gov). We also thank the [Karen Toffler Charitable Trust](https://tofflertrust.org) for funding our work.
