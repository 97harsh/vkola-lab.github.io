Our laboratory is interested in the development and validation of novel machine learning algorithms that can tackle multimodal data ranging from magnetic resonance imaging scans to voice recordings of individuals. We are currently interested in the following questions:

1. **Neurodegeneration** -- How can we develop software frameworks that can assist dementia diagnosis in various settings? 
2. **Digital pathology** -- How can be build clinical-grade software tools to complement the pathologist?
