We are currently interested in the following questions:

1. **Neurodegeneration**: How can we develop clinical-grade software frameworks that can assist with diagnosing dementia in various settings? 
2. **Understanding the noncoding genome**: Using whole-genome sequencing to identify the elements of the noncoding genome that contribute to ASD

### Technologies and methods
We develop and validate novel machine learning algorithms that can tackle multimodal data ranging from magnetic resonance imaging scans to voice recordings of individuals.

### Collaborators
We work with closely with numerous collaborators.
