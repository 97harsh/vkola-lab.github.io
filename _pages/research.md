## Phenotyping neurodegeneration
<div style="text-align: justify">
We build machine learning frameworks to process multimodal data and identify specific signatures of neurodegeneration. We have experience in dealing with large data cohorts such as the Framingham Heart Study and established several computational pipelines to efficiently process volumetric images of the brain, neuropathology and other modes of data and use them for further analysis. We collaborate with a diverse team of neurologists, neuropsychologists, neuropathologists and neuroradiologists to validate our computational findings.

## Digital pathology
<div style="text-align: justify">
We develop novel computational frameworks based on deep learning to assist the pathologist. Our current application areas include kidney disease and lung cancer.
